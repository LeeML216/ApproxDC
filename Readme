Three parameters input:
1. The input DB path
	The first line of the input DB is the schema
2. The threshold for k-frequent itemset mining algorithm for constant predicates for constant DCs
	Default is 0, which means no constant DC. 
	Suggested value, to be at least 0.6
3. The noise tolerance level for approximate DC discovery. 
	Default is 0, which means exact DCs.
	Suggested value, to be less than 0.4, depending on your confidence of the cleanness of the data

Distributed Version:


setup environment:
1,login to the cluster.qcri.org using username:yye, password: qcri123
2,use qstat -n command in cluster.qcri.org to check if any machines have been assigned to yye
3,if yes
                then go to experiement
  else
                use qsub -I -V -q long -l walltime=10:00:00,nodes=:ppn=8
                checkout using qstat -n which nodes have been allocated to yye.
                go to configure environment step (assignednodes).



configure environment step (assignednodes):
0: SERVER_NODE_NAME=(select random one from assignednodes)
1, go to directory: /data/yye/data/Distributed
2, configure clients file (put assignednodes, one per line)
3, configure server (put sERVER_NODE_NAME in the first line, make sure only one line in this file)
4, configure server.properties file as follows:
                servers=[assignednodes] (use comma to separate them)
                registry=9001
                rmiaddress=rmi://[SERVER_NODE_NAME]:9001/PredicateMatchService
5, go to experiment


experiment in distrubuted mode:
1, export jar file
2, put jar file into cluster.qcri.org:/home/yye/ConstraintInference/ConstraintInference.jar
3, login to the cluster.qcri.org using credential username:yye, password:qcri123
4, go to folder /home/yye/ConstraintInference
5,  java -jar ConstraintInference.jar [ARGUMENTS] (make sure Config.howInit == 2)


DFS time is in ms
Init time is in s
Total time is in s


qsub -I -V -q long -l walltime=72:00:00,nodes=4:ppn=8
